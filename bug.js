This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.appOwnership` API to determine if an app is running in a managed workflow or standalone mode.  The API inconsistently returns `true` (managed) even when the app is clearly running in standalone mode, leading to incorrect conditional logic within the application. This behavior is not consistently reproducible and appears to be intermittent.
